Design a C++ program for a hotel reservation system. Create a base class Room with attributes like room number, type (e.g., standard, deluxe), and nightly rate. Derive classes like StandardRoom and DeluxeRoom from Room. Implement functions to book rooms, calculate reservation costs, and list reservations.
